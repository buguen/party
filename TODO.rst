******** Move generated files tests from 'tests' to a function that can be used by library creators

******** Migrate issues from standard-cad-parts

******** units management : list in units section of JSON

******** Automate library.json generation based on the contents of the input file (contains {{ generators }}, aliases, __alias__

******** STEP, STL and HTML generation should be possible (but not automatic)

create an HTML file that allows querying the library?

materials

signature

'include' library creation mechanism
  impact on the autocreation

Doc !!

******** Skeleton generation from name : generate folder + 'generators' subfolder + library_template.py

Try to replace:

outer_diameter = {{ outer_diameter }}
inner_diameter = {{ inner_diameter }}
length = {{ length }}
tail_length = {{ tail_length }}

by autogenerated code

Strict nomenclature enforcement : where are we?

Clean standard-cad-parts from useless code

More library checks ?
  Metadata is the same for each part
  ******** Check units are coherent (every field linked to a unit)
